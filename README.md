## üìà Key Insights

### Correlation Analysis
- **Overall Correlation**: Weak positive correlation (r = 0.181) between payroll and wins
- **Season Variability**: Correlation strength varies significantly by season
- **Diminishing Returns**: Higher spending doesn't guarantee proportional success

### Efficiency Findings
- Teams with rookie contracts for star players often show highest efficiency
- Mid-market teams frequently outperform spending expectations
- High payrolls don't guarantee proportional regular season success

### Notable Patterns
- **Injury Impact**: High-payroll teams with injured stars often underperform
- **Development Success**: Teams with strong player development exceed payroll expectations
- **Coaching Effect**: Strategic coaching can maximize limited payroll effectiveness
